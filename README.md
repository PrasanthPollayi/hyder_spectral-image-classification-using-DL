I have successfully completed  by using Deep learning models ,which are most popular in the market.
Our project revolves around hyperspectral image processing, where we extract spatial and spectral features to understand Earth's surface. The primary objective is material classification using reflectance properties, employing Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and 3D CNN. We use advanced tools like Jupyter and Google Colab, importing the Indian Pines dataset for analysis. The models are evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Absolute Error (RMSE). Among the models, 3D CNN demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving 98% variance with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), making it a robust choice for hyperspectral image classification.
